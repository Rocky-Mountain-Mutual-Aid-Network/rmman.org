                <p>
                    We want you to start a pod! A pod is any small group of people who meet regularly for a purpose. That purpose could be
                    anything. Be it mutual aid, education, activism, emotional support, deep community building, learning something
                    together, sustainability, environmental repair, or any other purpose, we want to help you get started.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We outline a simple spiral of actions to get started.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Envision the pod’s purpose -> Invite people -> Set your schedule and norms -> Do your things together -> Connect with
                    our community -> Reflect and keep it going!
                </p>
