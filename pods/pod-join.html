                    We want you to join a pod! A pod is any small group of people who meet regularly for a purpose. That purpose could be
                    anything. Be it mutual aid, education, activism, emotional support, deep community building, learning something,
                    sustainability, environmental repair, or any other purpose we want to help you get started.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Fill out the form below and we'll do our best to match you with an existing pod or one that's forming.
                </p>
